# KnipTang-Engine

KnipTang-Engine is a open source 2D C++ Game Engine made with [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) and [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) for vector math.

# Description

KnipTang-Engine follows the same open source and freedom philosophy as C++, while still being user friendly. The level of complexatie is fully left to the user itself.

The Engine uses a Game Object Component system. This makes it really easy for the user to implement new Game Objects and add Build In or Custom Components to the Objects. Because of the Open Source nature of this Engine, the Build In Components can be easely understood and customised to each user preferences.

Game Objects can be added to a scene. Endless amount of scenes can be easly created, loaded and unloaded synchronically or asynchronically thanks to the build in SceneManager.

It was a real journey trying to understand the complicated nature of what all of the main elements of a Game Engine entail. 

# Goal

The main focus of this project has been trying to make a Game Engine that is purely made in C++.

# Use

Download the latest release of this project and compile/run in visual studio.

# Resources
