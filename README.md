# KnipTang-Engine

KnipTang-Engine is an open-source 2D C++ Game Engine made with [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) and [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) for vector math.

# Description

KnipTang-Engine follows the same open-source and freedom philosophy as C++, while still being user-friendly. The level of complexity is fully left to the user itself.

The Engine uses a Game Object Component system. This makes it really easy for the user to implement new Game Objects and add Built-in or Custom Components to the Objects. Because of the Open Source nature of this Engine, the Built-In Components can be easily understood and customized to each user's preferences.

Game Objects can be added to a scene. An endless amount of scenes can be easily created, loaded, and unloaded synchronically or asynchronically thanks to the Built-In SceneManager.

It was a real journey trying to understand the complicated nature of what all of the main elements of a Game Engine entail. 

# Goal

The main focus of this project has been trying to make a Game Engine that is purely made in C++.

# Use
